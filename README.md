ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @wanhkteo, you can call me Wan if you want (i dont really mind).
  
  Iâ€™m interested in lots of things such as photo/cinematography, tech, guitar, cars, gym, etc.....
  
  Iâ€™m currently learning a student in University of Malaysia Sarawak (UNIMAS) in the Foundations of Computing. I will also continue my studies in the Faculty of Computer Science in UNIMAS 
  after I finish my foundation studies. I hope to be have great success in my journey as a student here especially in computing as I absolute love tech and computing.
  
  Iâ€™m looking to learn, take, share codes and hopefully learn a lot about coding on GitHub and hopefully implement them in my life in a useful way. As of writing, I am pretty new here so 
  please do guide me around as I slowly learn!! If you have any questions you can contact me on my email but I would prefer you to contact me on my socials.
